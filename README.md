# Description

A site that functions like an e-commerce website, but for non-profit donations. This site makes it easy to donate to multiple different non-profits while only having to checkout once. You can add different Non-Profit Organizations to your cart, select the amount you'd like to give to each one, and send the payment through to all of them, seamlessly, all at once.
