# Description

A site that functions like an e-commerce website, but for non-profit donations. This site makes it easy to donate to multiple different non-profits while only having to checkout once. You can add different Non-Profit Organizations to your cart, select the amount you'd like to give to each one, and send the payment through to all of them, seamlessly, all at once.

## Cart
1. The user can input the amount they would like to donate for each non-profit and the total amount will be calculated.
2. Once the donate button is clicked, the user can make individual donations to the specific non-profit selected. The user's info, from the data-base, will be auto-populated to the every.org's form, promoting an easier donation experience.
3. Future Development - "Donation list" button - would be the "checkout" button and with a single transaction the user could donate to several non-profits.
